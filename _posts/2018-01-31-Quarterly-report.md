This reporting period, although shortened by the holiday break, was marked by a flurry of activity. In November, Campus Champions actively participated in SC17 via a variety of activities: an all-Champions meeting that boasted about 100 attendees, as well as individual meetings of regions and the leadership team; participation in and facilitation of the International HPC Training Consortium workshop; and a presentation and participation on panel discussing improving diversity in the workplace at the International Women in HPC program. 

Champions collaboration with other XSEDE-related activities continues with many Champions serving as UREP and XSEDE Empower program reviewers as well as increased communication with  Broader Engagement and NIP team members.

Other highlights from the quarter include: hosted all-Champions and ad-hoc calls featuring guest speakers, increased activity and participation at Community Chat calls, multiple Champions submissions to PEARC18â€™s call for proposals, facilitation and participation of Champions in Virtual Residency and Proposal Writing activities, hosting a variety of training activities on campus, promotion of Research Computing Stack Exchange and the recruitment of new students to the Student Champion program. 

Lastly, the Campus Engagement team continues to make strides in sustainability efforts and looks forward to celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the Campus Champions program. The number of Champion institutions is at steady state and recruitment efforts are being planned for 2018. Efforts continue to nurture the increased engagement of the volunteer leadership team which will complete its transition to being a fully elected group this summer. This leadership team will be empowered to help drive the future of the Champions community for the next ten years and beyond.
