Campus Champions continue to grow (517 champions at 266 institutions) and continue to have increasing participation in activities that help them be more effective helping researchers use research cyberinfrastructure.  In addition to the monthly All Champions Call and the Community Chat call, Champions are: collaborating to develop Ask.ci, a Q&A site; participating and leading efforts with the Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC); and engaging with the networking community via conferences and workshops.  Highlights for this period include the Grant Proposal Writing Apprenticeship and the Paper Writing Apprenticeship that arose from the Virtual Residency Workshops.

In spring 2017, the Virtual Residency (VR) program embarked on an additional activity, as a follow-on arising from a combination of the VR under OUʼs Campus CI Engineer grant and the XSEDE Campus Champions program. This activityʼs goal was to teach CI Facilitators how to write grant proposals, by writing a grant proposal together, so that the participants would be able to learn, from experienced PIs, not only the basic structures of grant proposal writing, but also how to think strategically about proposals and projects.

Originally, the Grant Proposal Writing Apprenticeshipʼs approach was to develop an NSF workshop proposal at mid-5-figures, to fund a few intermediate-level VR summer workshops. A one-page precis of the intended workshop proposal was developed by the Apprenticeship, and was sent to the relevant NSF program officer. Feedback on the one-page precis suggested that a full NSF CyberTraining proposal, with significantly expanded scope and scale, would be appropriate, and this became the new focus of the Apprenticeship.

The CyberTraining proposal was developed by the Grant Proposal Writing Apprenticeship team over a period of many months, starting in summer 2017 (and submitted in mid-February 2018). The proposal was developed as an entirely volunteer effort. The proposal writing team had a total of 67 participants, from 52 institutions in 31 US states and territories and 1 other country, including 10 Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), 12 non-PhD-granting institutions, and 19 institutions in 13 EPSCoR jurisdictions.

After the proposal was submitted, the Apprenticeship went on hiatus. The proposal was ultimately declined, so the Grant Proposal Writing Apprenticeship has been reactivated for 2018-19, to submit a new CyberTraining proposal.

During the 2018 Virtual Residency workshop, the workshop participants and leaders realized that CI Facilitators need capability in writing scholarly publications, at a level comparable to the need for grant proposal writing. Therefore, a new Paper Writing Apprenticeship has been established, currently focused on developing a paper about the 2018 VR workshop for the PEARC'19 conference, using an approach similar to that of the Grant Proposal Writing Apprenticeship. If time permits, additional papers may be pursued as well.
