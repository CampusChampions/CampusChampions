An exciting highlight for this quarter is that we have just onboarded five new Champions from the University of Guam! With the addition of the University of Guam to our program, there are now Champions in every state and every EPSCoR jurisdiction! 

Our progress toward sustainability this period continues with the kick-off of our Champion Leadership Team election that will culminate in a fully-elected team by July 2018. Last year, we held our very first election in which half of the team (of six) was elected by the community. We are currently accepting nominations for outgoing team members and elections are planned for May/June. Each cohort serves two years to provide consistency, knowledge-sharing and succession planning to the Leadership Team. Additional sustainability activities include developing a survey to help measure the impact of the Champion program and to identify and prioritize future activities for the community. This survey is being developed as a collaborative effort between the Champion Sustainability Working Group (which includes the Champion Leadership Team and staff) and XSEDE staff evaluators.

Several Champion-led submissions to the PEARC18 conference were accepted including a Champion Plenary Panel, Champion Fellows presentations, and a Champion 101 workshop.  The Champion Fellows have been presenting their projects during the monthly All Champions Calls in preparation for their PEARC18 presentations. Also, the application process for a new cohort of Fellows is currently in progress. For the ten-year anniversary of the Champion program, Champion staff are working with the XSEDE External Relations team to produce a video showcasing the Champions themselves. So far dozens of Champions have submitted videos for this effort. The final product will be available for the PEARC18 conference.

While the core of Champion communication is the email list and Slack network, Champions meet face-to-face whenever an opportunity arises. In April, the Region 4 Champions (and many potential Champions) held a Birds of a Feather session at the CADRE Conference at Oklahoma State University. In addition, our staff is working to identify and provide programming that is of value and interest to all members of the community (e.g. faculty vs. systems facing Champions).
