subtitle: What, why?

Some Champions on Slack (ahem, Doug, Jack, etc.) had some ideas about making some materials useful to Champions.  A proposal for revamping the "Campus Champion 101" materials for a PEARC18 submission was mentioned. And so was a "CC Playbook".  These are all questions around the topic of matching reseearchers with the right resources.  Next step is to make a repository in this GitHub org (if we have a quorum) and potentially organizing these sorts of materials and maybe planning the workshop at the same time.
