title: Quarterly Report - PEARC Edition
subtitle: May 1, 2018 - July 31, 2018

A Campus Champions survey was conducted this quarter by the XSEDE External Evaluators, who also held focus groups at PEARC. Champions generally rated Overall Experience in the program positively; individuals from Minority Serving Institutions, teaching-focused institutions and non-profits, as well as faculty from all institution types, reported higher ratings than other groups.  Further analysis is ongoing.

The Campus Champions now have a Leadership Team that is entirely elected, instead of appointed as in the first several years of XSEDE (and TeraGrid). This approach is expected to improve sustainability for the Champions community. The current Leadership Team consists of:
* Hussein Al-Azzawi, University of New Mexico (2018-2020)
* Aaron Culich, University of California-Berkeley (2017-2019)
* Doug Jennewein, University of South Dakota (2018-2020)
* Alla Kammerdiner, New Mexico State University (2017-2019)
* Julie Ma, MGHPCC (2018-2020)
* Timothy Middelkoop, University of Missouri (2018-2020)

Champions constituted a large fraction of PEARC attendees (154 of 657, over 23%), and were active (and in many cases leaders) in every aspect of the conference, serving on the conference committee and as reviewers, content submitters and of course attendees. At PEARC, the Champions held a public celebration of their 10th anniversary, including press, a Champion anniversary video (created in collaboration with the XSEDE External Relations team), and a retrospective at the Champion plenary session. Champions participated in a broad variety of sessions, including as speakers, panelists, moderators and session organizers. Highlights included a first-of-its-kind Campus Champion 101 workshop, the PEEQ@PEARC workshop on emotional intelligence, and a Birds-of-a-Feather session, “On Launching a Research Computing Q&A Platform.” Campus Engagement L3 joint co-manager Dana Brunson was elected to the PEARC steering committee.

Brunson is also co-leading a joint effort with the NSF-funded Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC) People Network, which is now holding monthly sessions for researcher-facing practice. Brunson and co-manager Henry Neeman conducted ad hoc videconferencing sessions, jointly with CaRCC, on grant proposal writing and grant proposal reviewing, as a core professional development component of the Campus Champions program.

Preparations have been underway for the Virtual Residency’s inaugural Intermediate workshop, to be held August 5-10 2018 at the University of Oklahoma. This is the fourth Virtual Residency workshop, but the first at the intermediate level. The workshop so far has over 270 registrants, from over 160 institutions in 46 US states and territories and 5 other countries on 3 continents, including over 70 new institutions that have never participated before. Taking into account previous Virtual Residency activities, over 500 research computing professionals have been served, or are scheduled to be served, from over 250 institutions in 53 US states and territories and 7 other countries on 4 continents, including: 171 Campus Champion institutions (65% of VR institutions, 66% of CC institutions), 37 minority serving institutions; 52 primarily undergraduate and other non-PhD-granting academic institutions, 72 institutions in 25 of 26 EPSCoR jurisdictions (all except Guam), 4 community colleges, 5 high schools, 15 government agencies (federal, state, non-US), 7 private companies, and 12 non-profit/non-governmental organizations.
